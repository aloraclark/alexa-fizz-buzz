# Alexa Fizz Buzz
This is my code for my Amazon Alexa Skill modeled after the famous game FizzBuzz!

The rules of the game are simple:
Count up from 1, replacing each number divisible by 3 with buzz, each number divisible by 5 with fizz, and each number divisible by 3 and 5 with fizzbuzz.
This skill is modeled so that alexa should never lose.

Alexa can handle "stop", "cancel", "repeat", and "help" commands. 

To use this skill you must have access to the amazon developer console, the ask-sdk extension in your IDE (Visual Studio Code has a very simple and easy extension), or an Amazon Echo. To invoke the skill simply say or type "open fizz buzz".

If you are using the Amazon Developer Console and typing your responses she accepts numbers as any form (integer or written), "fizz", "buzz", and "fizzbuzz" as responses to the game logic.
